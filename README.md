# -CP-Shane-girl-mod
Content patcher version for rekooooon's mod. 

Should work with OhoDavi's portraits in Vortex unadjusted. 

For some reason the author included new cursors files. Not quite sure the exact reason, but it probably wasn't a very good one since they seem prone to changes over new Stardew Valley updates. I've included a separate "no LooseSprites" version to remove them and have also kept a version with the original in case they were important.

(This mod will be obsolete soon so this was more of a mini-project to help me understand CP and SMAPI)
